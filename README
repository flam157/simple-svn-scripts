                       SimpleSVN scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Author : RÃ©mi Flamary

These scripts are a list of simple subversion scripts modified from 
nautilus svn scripts:
http://marius.scurtescu.com/?p=102

Basically I just added pipes that can show you the evolution of the 
svn output witout waiting for the finall result. And the commit script
 was modified in order to be more tortoise-like.

The name of the scripts is a tribute to both a really nice algorithm
to solve QP problems and a matlab toolbox from Gaelle Loosli that you
can download here:
